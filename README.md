# NSS-Modern-Javascript-Developer-Shake-Your-Fist-At-The-Sky
## Motivation
This was Javascript practice done while attending the [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/).

## Synopsis
### Shake your fist at the sky
Practice jQuery and Promises and optionally Handlebars
 
1. Accept two dates from the user (year, month, day) as a search parameter.
1. Use the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS) to make an ajax call that will gather data about what objects will be close to our planet in the timeframe specified by the user’s dates.
1. Using the data you get back from NASA (promises!), use FOAAS to tell three of those asteroids to fuck off, by name.  http://www.foaas.com/
1. You can use whichever of the foaas message types you like.
1. Print these sky-fist-shaking statements to the DOM
 
### Bonus: 
1. Only tell those asteroids that are “potentially hazardous” to fuck off.
1. Use different messages from foaas for the different asteroids.
1. Use Handlebars to print your three messages to the DOM
